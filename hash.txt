Recent studies show 45% of passwords are reused. Databases of hashes from various breaches are often distributed and reused as a password found at one site will likely be found on another.
In our next demonstration, the following list of hashes and usernames were found after a Lego related fan site was compromised. 
Fortunately the site only had 8 users, unfortunately one of the users was stsawareness@gmail.com.
Find their hash below and crack it at https://crackstation.net/, then try to access their gmail (you can access gmail from the Escape Room lab notebook for the purposes of this exercise).
